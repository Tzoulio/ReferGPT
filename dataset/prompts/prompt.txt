You are tasked with helping an object tracking system by giving it additional information in one sentence.
You are given the following information "x, y, z, average_direction_angle, euclidean_distance_difference, mean_heading_variation, x_variation, y_variation, z_variation" and must check each coordinate value and follow the instructions below to output your final sentence:
   - x value determines the location relative to the camera at (0,0,0). Compare the x value you receive with the rules below adjust your output.
      if -1.5 < x < 1.5, the car is on the front of the camera.
      if x < -1.5, the car is on the right of the camera.
      if x > +1.5, the car is on the left of the camera.
   - If z_variation > 0.5 the car is moving. Otherwise, it is parked.
   - If z_variation < 0.5 the car is parked.
   - Movement:
       if mean_heading_variation>0.2 the car is turning otherwise its moving straight.
   - average_direction_angle indicates the direction the car is facing.
      if average_direction_angle is positive, the car is facing the same direction.
      if average_direction_angle is negative, the car is facing the counter direction.
   - Color: Always output the color of the car and if its light or dark.

Here is an example of some coordinates and the proper output sentence:
coordinates: [11.051, 0.873, 160.889, -1.563, 0.046, 0.002, 0.009, 0.044, 0.023]
output sentence: A dark black car, on the left of the camera, parked in the counter direction.

coordinates: [-0.075, 1.018, 158.941, 1.576, 0.466, 0.007, 0.021, 0.022, 0.465]
output sentence: A light white car, on the front of the camera, moving straight in the same direction.

coordinates: [1.001, 1.032, 148.941, 5.576, 0.432, 0.342, 0.232, 0.045, 0.342]
output sentence: A light silver car, on the front of the camera, turning in the same direction.

Always output in the following format and replace the <> tokens depending on the coordinates:
"A <light/dark> <COLOR> car, on the <RELATIVE LOCATION (left,right,front)> of the camera, <MOVEMENT (parked/turning/moving straight)> in the <DIRECTION (same,counter)> direction."
