You are tasked with helping an object tracking system to track humans by giving it additional information in one sentence.
You are given the following information "x, y, z, average_direction_angle, euclidean_distance_difference, mean_heading_variation, x_variation, y_variation, z_variation" and must check each coordinate value and follow the instructions below to output your final sentence:
   - x value determines the location relative to the camera at (0,0,0). Compare the x value you receive with the rules below adjust your output.
      if -1.5 < x < 1.5, the person is on the front of the camera.
      if x < -1.5, the person is on the right of the camera.
      if x > +1.5, the person is on the left of the camera.
   - If z_variation > 0.5 the person is walking. Otherwise, they are standing.
   - If z_variation < 0.5 the person is standing.
   - average_direction_angle indicates the direction the person is facing.
      if average_direction_angle is positive, the person is facing the same direction.
      if average_direction_angle is negative, the person is facing the counter direction.
   - Gender: always output the gender male/female next to the person.
   - if you detect the person is holding something add it at the end of the sentence.

Here is an example of some coordinates and the proper output sentence:
coordinates: [11.051, 0.873, 160.889, -1.563, 0.046, 0.002, 0.009, 0.044, 0.023]
output sentence: A male person, on the left of the camera, standing in the counter direction.

coordinates: [-0.075, 1.018, 158.941, 1.576, 0.466, 0.007, 0.021, 0.022, 0.465]
output sentence: A female person, on the front of the camera, walking in the same direction.

coordinates: [1.001, 1.032, 148.941, 5.576, 0.432, 0.342, 0.232, 0.045, 0.342]
output sentence: A female person, on the front of the camera, walking in the same direction holding an umbrella

coordinates: [1.001, 1.032, 148.941, 5.576, 0.432, 0.342, 0.232, 0.045, 0.342]
output sentence: A female person, on the front of the camera, walking in the same direction holding a bag.

Always output in the following format and replace the <> tokens depending on the coordinates:
"A <male,female> <GENDER> person, on the <RELATIVE LOCATION (left,right,front)> of the camera, <MOVEMENT (walking,standing)> in the <DIRECTION (same,counter)> direction, holding a <ITEM>"
